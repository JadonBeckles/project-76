     Black holes are objects of both great mass, density and are found throughout the Universe. The most significant black holes are called supermassive black holes, and they are commonly found in the center of galaxies. Black holes vary in size â€“ the smallest can be as little as an asteroid, while others reach billions of mi/km in diameter.

Einstein first predicted Their existence due to his theory of general relativity. When a star with great mass reaches the end of its life, it leaves behind a dead core. If this core has three times the Sun's mass, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.

All matter inside a black hole is compressed to a point called the singularity. This, in a sense, is the hole. The event horizon is the black sphere of the black hole. It reflects no light, and it is the point of no return. 

Anything that crosses the event horizon can no longer escape. Though they are termed the vacuum cleaners of the Universe, black holes don't necessarily "suck" up everything. They aren't so efficient. The matter must be very close to getting pulled in. If the Sun were replaced with a black hole, it wouldn't engulf us.
 
The closest supermassive black hole to our little Earth is the one located in the center of the Milky Way named Sagittarius A*. It is around 25.640 light-years away from us. Currently, the closest "regular" black hole to us to be discovered is named V616 Monocerotis, at around 3.000 light-years away from Earth. The supermassive black hole, which is at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy, is the first to be photographed. 

This happened in 2019. The first black hole to be discovered and acknowledged by the scientific community is named Cygnus X-1. This happened in 1971. The person who first coined the term "black hole" was John Archibald Wheeler in the 1960s. Black holes cannot be directly observed. Their effects, however, can be monitored and often give away their location.
